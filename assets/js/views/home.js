              <p>In the fast-paced world of retail and logistics, information is everywhere: in your POS system, in messy spreadsheets, and in those stacks of invoices on your desk. But for many small and medium business owners, getting that data to "talk" to each other feels like a second full-time job.</p>
              
              <p>With over 20 years of experience in the heart of retail operations, I’ve seen firsthand how manual data entry slows down growth and leads to costly mistakes. Today, I combine my deep operational background with advanced automation to help businesses bridge these gaps.</p>

              <h2>The Problem: The "Data Gap"</h2>
              <p>Most businesses use multiple programs—like <strong>QuickBooks, Excel, and custom inventory systems</strong>. The struggle begins when you need to move data between them.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Are you manually typing invoice data into your accounting software?</li>
                  <li>Are you unsure if your inventory counts actually match your sales reports?</li>
                  <li>Do you spend hours every week just "cleaning up" spreadsheets?</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How I Help: Structure, Automation, and Integrity</h2>
              <p>I specialize in building invisible "bridges" between your programs. Here is exactly what I can do for your business:</p>
              
              <h3>1. Seamless Data Transfer (The "Bridge")</h3>
              <p>I use tools like <strong>Advanced Power Query and SQL</strong> to automate the flow of data. Instead of exporting a file and manually reformatting it, I build a system where the data moves itself—accurately and instantly.</p>

              <h3>2. Procedure Automation</h3>
              <p>If you have a task you do every day that involves repetitive manual steps, I can automate it. By applying <strong>VBA scripting and dynamic workflows</strong>, I turn hours of work into seconds.</p>

              <h3>3. Data Integrity & Control</h3>
              <p>Bad data leads to bad decisions. I analyze your current data structure to find errors and implement "integrity checks" to ensure your numbers are 100% correct.</p>

              <h2>Why Choose a Specialist Who Knows Your Industry?</h2>
              <p>Unlike a typical programmer who only knows code, I have spent a my whole career more then 25 years learning the retail and purchasing industry from the ground up. I don't just fix the software; I understand the process behind the data.</p>
